# Georgetown University Math & Statistics 511 **EXERCISES**

these notebooks are the exercises for the GU511 course. Each of them will be
named / identified by their corresponding due date:

```
YYYY_MM_DD.ipynb
```

what exactly is "due" will change from assignment to assignment, but will be
spelled out in detail in every assignment.

## obtaining homework files

you don't *need* to download the individual `jupyter notebook` files that make
up your homework assignment, but you are welcome to do so if you'd prefer. there
are a few ways to do that:

### use `git`**

simply `git clone https://github.com/rzl-ds/gu511_hw.git` one
time and obtain all future updates by calling `git pull`


### download a single file

you can download any single *raw* notebook file.
   1. note: the page you land on when you click the `YYYY_MM_DD.ipynb` link is
      an `html` document rendering that notebook. `jupyter` will not
